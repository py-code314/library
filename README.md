# Library App

## Library Project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library)

## Overview

This is a small Library App where users can add or remove books from their library. The app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

There's a Navbar on the left side of the page which contains links (non-functional) to the other pages. There are two main sections in the main section of the page: The Library section and the Continue Reading section which are displayed like a grid of books. On the top of the page you can see a search bar and a section for profile details of the user (They're also non-functional at the moment).

Upon page finished loading, user will see that some books are already added in 'Continue Reading' and 'Library' sections. User can add more books by clicking 'Add Book' button in 'Your Library' section. A form will appear and user can fill out the form to add a new book.

User can also update book details by clicking 'Update' button and remove a book by using 'Delete' button which show up on the book card when hovering over it. Clicking the 'Update' button will show a form where user can update the book details except the title of the book. When user clicks the 'Delete' button, the book will be removed from the library and the book card will be removed from the DOM.
